          <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Summary</h2>
          <p class="govuk-body">Back in 2019, Oxford City Council ran a Citizens Assembly on the climate emergency to understand more about what the residents wanted the council to do. This led to the council committing to 53 specific actions to help fight climate change, and one of these was to run a youth climate summit to engage young people in the topic.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">The summit was originally planned as an in-person event, but as the Covid-19 pandemic continued the council decided to move it online, and in September 2020 hosted its first youth climate summit over Zoom and YouTube. The event was chaired by young people, and included interactive tools so that participants could get involved with the discussions and choose what content they wanted to see.</p>

              <p class="govuk-body">We started with researching what was already happening in Oxford with young people and climate action. Who were the young people already active? Who were the organisations working with young people? What sort of work was already happening?

                This helped us to identify gaps where the summit could play a role, as well as high priority themes we might want to cover.
