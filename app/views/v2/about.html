          <p class="govuk-body">This playbook has been created to help local authorities learn from each other about how they can improve their digital community engagement.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">The COVID-19 pandemic has had a big impact on how local authorities can engage with their citizens, with many traditional face-to-face engagement methods not currently possible. They’ve needed to devise new ways to interact, consult and engage with citizens. The playbook brings together practical case studies of how different local authorities in England have used digital approaches to do this.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">The case studies include key guidance, and break down each example into steps so that other local authorities can replicate something similar in their own area.</p>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Digital inclusion</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">While the pandemic has led to new forms of digital engagement, it has also heightened pre-existing issues around accessibility and digital inclusion. This is an ongoing challenge.
              The focus of the playbook is on digital methods, but if you want to find out more about engaging the digitally excluded, please visit the <a target="_blank" href="https://digitalinclusionkit.org/"></a>Digital Inclusion Toolkit</a>, led by Leeds City and Croydon councils.</p>
