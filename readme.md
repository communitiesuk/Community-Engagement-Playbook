# Introduction

Throughout COVID-19 local authorities have needed to find new and different ways to interact, consult and engage with citizens. The Local Digital Collaboration Unit (LDCU) at the Ministry for Housing Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) commissioned a discovery around how a playbook could capture and share these new practices so that local authorities can learn from each other.

The focus of this discovery was to:

1. Define the user needs councils have around community engagement that the playbook would address.
1. Identify the local constraints that councils face when engaging with communities, and use these insights to build a taxonomy and case study structure.
1. Create and test a prototype based on user insights to develop something tangible as a final output.

## Prototypes

We designed two prototypes as part of the discovery. The first was a Figma prototype that we used to test the format, taxonomy, information architecture and case study structure of the playbook. The second built on the insights from testing the Figma prototype and used the GOV.UK prototype kit. This HTML prototype should be tested with users during the alpha phase.

## Security

If you publish your prototypes online, they must be protected by a username and password. This is to prevent members of the public finding prototypes and thinking they are real services.
